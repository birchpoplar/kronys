## Objective

Demonstrate utility of a new paradigm in modeling the financial statements of small businesses.

Expected usage primarily for educational purposes.

## Design

Financial activity in a business can be distilled down into individual *actors*. Each actor creates transactions that affect one or more general ledger accounts over a specified timescale. Any concept in financial modeling can be distilled down to one or more actors, in some cases many actors.

Such an approach allows segregation of two key aspects of modelling:
1. The model algorithm, that generates the ledger transactions and resulting financial statements
2. The inputs, or specifications of actors

## Status

Project is at a very early stage of development and likely to evolve a lot in structure!
